## FoodNow
# App Narrative
Did you ever go to a restaurant and come back because it’s full or wait for a long time to be seated. But now with this application you do not have to. ‘Food Now’ is crowd sourced application, in which users can know the status of the restaurants. In case the restaurant is full, users can find the nearby restaurants based on their GPS coordinates. If the users are unable to decide on the restaurant they can also see the popular restaurants nearby and can choose which restaurant they want to go to. User can update the status of the restaurant they are in or nearby. User should log on to the app to update the status of a restaurant, they can login using their Facebook account, google plus accounts or they can create a new account with the app. If the user wants to just view the status of restaurant then log in is not needed. This app can be used anywhere in the world, but the restaurants should be registered by the owner before the users can see them. This app is for every person who owns a smartphone and does not like to wait. 
# Need for Application
There are applications where owners can update the wait period of the restaurant, but sometimes owners do not tend to be completely truthful. With crowdsourcing people who are currently waiting at the restaurant can update the status of the app so that other users can find restaurants with lower wait times or lesser crowd.
# Target Market 
Restaurant patrons, owners who like to publicize their restaurant for low wait times and high demand.
